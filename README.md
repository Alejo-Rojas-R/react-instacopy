# Project Description

This project was developed by taking inspiration from [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) where I've tried to replicate some of its functionalities and interface by using the React library. It's composed of:
- Multiple components that use different Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useParams, etc. 
- Navigation menu that helps you browse trough multiple pages, developed by using the react-router-dom package.
- API calls to get some dummy data, from [DummyJSON](dummyjson.com), [JSONPlaceholder](jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and [Reqres](reqres.in)
