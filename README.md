# Project Description

This project was developed by taking inspiration from [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) where I've tried to replicate some of its functionalities and interface by using the React library. It's composed of:
- Multiple components with props that use different Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useParams, useRef, etc. 
- Navigation menu that helps you browse trough multiple pages, developed by using the react-router-dom package.
- API calls to get some dummy data, from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/), [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and [Reqres](https://reqres.in/)
