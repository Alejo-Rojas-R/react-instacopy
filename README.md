This project was developed by taking inspiration from Instagram where I've tried to replicate some of its functionalities and interface by using the React library. 

Composed of:
- Multiple components that use different Hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useParams, etc. 
- Navigation menu that helps you browse trough multiple pages by using the react-router-dom package.
- API calls to get dummy data from dummyjson.com, jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and reqres.in
